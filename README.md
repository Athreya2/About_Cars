Engines are the reason you are able to move a 4000 pound metal box from one place to another
<br>
But, did you know that there are mainly <strong> two different types of engines </strong>
<br>
![Internal Combustion Engine](IC_Engine.jpg)
Simple, an IC Engine is where the combustion happens withing the piston itself (Used in our modern vehicles)
<br>
![External Combustion Engine](IC_Engine.jpg)
On the other hand, the Internal Combustion Engine has the combustion, that drives the vehicle, outside the piston.
<br>
<h2> Within these Engines, there are other factors that can affect the amount of power generated, such as: Piston Congiurations, # of pistons, etc. </h2>
The average car has 4 pistons working simultaneously in an Engine
However, there are cars that have a higher number of pistons, that can deliver more horsepower compared to the latter.
