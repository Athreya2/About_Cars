<strong> This is a simplified explanation of all the components of a car. </strong>

<h1>  <strong> Engines </strong> </h1>
</p>
<br>
Engines are the reason you are able to move a 4000 pound metal box from one place to another
<br>
But, did you know that there are mainly <strong> two different types of engines </strong>
<br>
![Internal Combustion Engine](IC_Engine.jpg)
Simple, an IC Engine is where the combustion happens withing the piston itself (Used in our modern vehicles)
<br>
![External Combustion Engine](IC_Engine.jpg)
On the other hand, the Internal Combustion Engine has the combustion, that drives the vehicle, outside the piston.
<br>
<h4> Within these Engines, there are other factors that can affect the amount of power generated, such as: Piston Congiurations, # of pistons, etc. </h4>
The average car has 4 pistons working simultaneously in an Engine
However, there are cars that have a higher number of pistons, that can deliver more horsepower compared to the latter.
![V4 Engine](V4_Engine.jpg)
This is your typical engine with 4 pistons
![V12 Engine](V12_Engine.jpg)
This engine has 12 pistons that work simultaneously to move the vehicle

<h1> Fuel System</h1>
In a car, you will find that the fuel tank connects to the Engine through a fuel rail
These rails are made to help inject a specfic amount of fuel into the cylinders of the Engine (to create the combustion to drive the car).
To have a pictorial representation of the fuel systme in a car visit:
